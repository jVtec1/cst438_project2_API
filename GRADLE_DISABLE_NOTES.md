# Temporarily disable Gradle detection
# Rename these files back after successful Docker deployment:
# build.gradle -> build.gradle.bak
# settings.gradle -> settings.gradle.bak
# gradlew -> gradlew.bak
# gradlew.bat -> gradlew.bat.bak

# This forces Heroku to use Docker instead of auto-detecting Gradle
